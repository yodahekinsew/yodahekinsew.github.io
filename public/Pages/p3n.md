# THE P3N
## A 3D Digital Drawing Pen
### Overview
My friends and I built a really fun project in a class called 6.08 (or Embedded systems). The project was a 3D drawing tool, which we named the P3N. The entire system used a microcontroller device, a website renderer built with Three.js, and a SQLite python-based server. The system allowed users to draw in 3D - either alone or collaboritvely with other users - and gave users control over certain aspects of their drawing expericene, such as pen size, drawing speed, pen color, and others. The device used a microphone sensor to receive commands from the user and an IMU for directional input from the user.
