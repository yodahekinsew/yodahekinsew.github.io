# EDUCATION
## Degree
#### Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, August 2017 - June 2020

## Favorite Courses
### Computer Graphics
I had a ton of fun learning a lot of cool computer graphics techniques such as bezier/b-spline curves, skeletal subsurface deformations, particle systems, inverse kinematics, and ray tracing during this class. A lot of the stuff I learned in this class helped shape my independent Unity projects which was awesome. I also learned about the beauty that is shaders!
### Engineering Interactive Technologies
Introduction to interactive technologies with an emphasis on wearables and Human Computer Interaction. Developed a multi-touch surface using silver-ink printing. 
### Intelligent Multimodal User Interfaces
Exposed to different modalities of user interaction such as stroke detection, voice recognition, facial expressions, and gesture recognition systems. Built a final project called HeyReddit that utilized gestures, face expressions, and voice commands in order to interface with Reddit.
### Mobile and Sensor Computing
Introduction to the power of Internet-of-Things and exposure to different signal processing techniques and swift programming in order to build ios apps that interact with the world around them. As a final project, I - along with two friends - built a running app called TempoRun that can detect the tempo of a user's run using FFT. The app then uses the Spotify API in order to select music that is playing at the same tempo. 
### Principles and Practices of Assistive Technology
One of my favorite classes because it's the only class I know of at MIT where you get to work with an actual person and try to develop some technology that can help them. For this class, I worked with a team to help our client - Lora - by building her a customized walker that was light enough for to use around the house and also stable enough for her to put her weight on it.
### How to Make (Almost) Anything
An awesome but also difficult course where each week you learn how to make a new piece of technology. 
### Embedded Systems
My first introduction to embedded systems, this was the class that really made feel like an engineer! In this class, I learned a lot about how microcontrollers work and how to use sensors and Arduino to create incredible systems easily. For my final project, my friends and I made a 3D pen - understandably called the P3N - as well as a 3D visualizing website, so that users could digitally draw in 3D.
