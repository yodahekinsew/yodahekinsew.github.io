# FARMPULSE
## Media Lab Research with the Space Enabled Group
### Time and Location
From January, 2020 - June, 2020
Located at the MIT Media Lab

### Overview
Designed and developed a "Farmpulse" react-native app that empowered farmers around the world to analyze their own farms and report any disasters that occurred on their farms. These reports make it simple for farmers to keep track of the necessary information for insurance claims.   
 
Implemented a companion reactJS website that would utilize user-input from these farmers to display food security information around the world. The website featured a Mapbox map with layers representing food security information organized by both crop type and disaster type. All Farmpulse information was sourced to the Mapbox map using a custom api built with postgresql.
